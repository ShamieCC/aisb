=== GHIDRA ANALYSIS WALKTHROUGH ===

GETTING STARTED WITH GHIDRA:
=============================

1. IMPORTING THE BINARY
   - Open Ghidra and create a new project
   - File -> Import File -> Select your compiled binary
   - Accept default import settings
   - Double-click the binary to open CodeBrowser

2. INITIAL ANALYSIS
   - When prompted, choose "Yes" to analyze the binary
   - Use default analysis options (or enable additional analyzers)
   - Wait for analysis to complete

ANALYZING THE BASIC OVERFLOW EXERCISE:
=====================================

3. LOCATE THE MAIN FUNCTION
   - In Symbol Tree, expand Functions -> main (or entry)
   - Double-click main to navigate to it
   - Switch to Decompile view (Window -> Decompile)

4. IDENTIFY THE VULNERABILITY
   - Look for the gets() function call - this is unsafe
   - Note the buffer size: char password[16]
   - Find the flag variable: int local_10 = 0

6. CALCULATE OVERFLOW OFFSET
   - Buffer size: 16 bytes
   - Local variable size: 4 bytes (int local_10)
   - so, what happens when we input more than 16 bytes?
